# new-ssn

A Javascript class (*new-fi-ssn.js*) for testing the new Finnish SSN rules, currently planned to arrive in 2024.

You can run the new-fi-ssn.js file as a standalone module or import it to your project. Included is also the node.js package *http-server* for running the project at the address http://localhost:8080 by typing `npm start`. The rest of the repo is in Finnish. It includes test cases and you can also test your own input for adherence to the new rules.
